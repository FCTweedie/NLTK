We could test for bigrams (words that typically occur side by side) to see if this is the case. In order to perform this test, we must first convert our list of tokens into and NLTK text. We can then use specific NLTK functions on the text."

    "Central to the theory is a division between **experiential meanings** and **interpersonal meanings**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Experiential meanings communicate what happened to whom, under what circumstances.\n",

    "* Participants (*a man, green bikes*)\n",
    "* Processes (*sleep, has always been, is considering*)\n",
    "* Circumstances (*on the weekend*, *in Australia*)\n",

    "Mood features of a language include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mood types (*declarative, interrogative, imperative*)\n",
    "* Modality (*would, can, might*)\n",
    "* Lexical density--wordshe number of words per clause, the number of content to non-content words, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lexical density is usually a good indicator of the general tone of texts. The language of academia, for example, often has a huge number of nouns to verbs. We can approximate an academic tone simply by making nominally dense clauses: \n",
    "\n",
    "      The consideration of interest is the potential for a participant of a certain demographic to be in Group A or Group B*.\n",
